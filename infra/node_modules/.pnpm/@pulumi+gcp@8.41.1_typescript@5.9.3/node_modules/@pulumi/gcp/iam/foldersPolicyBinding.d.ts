/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Iam Folders Policy Binding
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * import * as time from "@pulumiverse/time";
 *
 * const pabPolicy = new gcp.iam.PrincipalAccessBoundaryPolicy("pab_policy", {
 *     organization: "123456789",
 *     location: "global",
 *     displayName: "binding for all principals in the folder",
 *     principalAccessBoundaryPolicyId: "my-pab-policy",
 * });
 * const folder = new gcp.organizations.Folder("folder", {
 *     displayName: "my folder",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     deletionProtection: false,
 * });
 * const wait120s = new time.index.Sleep("wait_120s", {createDuration: "120s"}, {
 *     dependsOn: [folder],
 * });
 * const binding_for_all_folder_principals = new gcp.iam.FoldersPolicyBinding("binding-for-all-folder-principals", {
 *     folder: folder.folderId,
 *     location: "global",
 *     displayName: "binding for all principals in the folder",
 *     policyKind: "PRINCIPAL_ACCESS_BOUNDARY",
 *     policyBindingId: "binding-for-all-folder-principals",
 *     policy: pulumi.interpolate`organizations/123456789/locations/global/principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/${pabPolicy.principalAccessBoundaryPolicyId}`,
 *     target: {
 *         principalSet: pulumi.interpolate`//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/folders/${folder.folderId}`,
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [wait120s],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * FoldersPolicyBinding can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `folders/{{folder}}/locations/{{location}}/policyBindings/{{policy_binding_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{folder}}/{{location}}/{{policy_binding_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, FoldersPolicyBinding can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iam/foldersPolicyBinding:FoldersPolicyBinding default folders/{{folder}}/locations/{{location}}/policyBindings/{{policy_binding_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iam/foldersPolicyBinding:FoldersPolicyBinding default {{folder}}/{{location}}/{{policy_binding_id}}
 * ```
