/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Iam Principal Access Boundary Policy
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const pab_policy_for_org = new gcp.iam.PrincipalAccessBoundaryPolicy("pab-policy-for-org", {
 *     organization: "123456789",
 *     location: "global",
 *     displayName: "PAB policy for Organization",
 *     principalAccessBoundaryPolicyId: "pab-policy-for-org",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Iam Organizations Policy Binding
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * import * as time from "@pulumiverse/time";
 *
 * const pabPolicy = new gcp.iam.PrincipalAccessBoundaryPolicy("pab_policy", {
 *     organization: "123456789",
 *     location: "global",
 *     displayName: "Binding for all principals in the Organization",
 *     principalAccessBoundaryPolicyId: "my-pab-policy",
 * });
 * const wait60Seconds = new time.index.Sleep("wait_60_seconds", {createDuration: "60s"}, {
 *     dependsOn: [pabPolicy],
 * });
 * const my_pab_policy = new gcp.iam.OrganizationsPolicyBinding("my-pab-policy", {
 *     organization: "123456789",
 *     location: "global",
 *     displayName: "Binding for all principals in the Organization",
 *     policyKind: "PRINCIPAL_ACCESS_BOUNDARY",
 *     policyBindingId: "binding-for-all-org-principals",
 *     policy: pulumi.interpolate`organizations/123456789/locations/global/principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/${pabPolicy.principalAccessBoundaryPolicyId}`,
 *     target: {
 *         principalSet: "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/123456789",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [wait60Seconds],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * PrincipalAccessBoundaryPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/{{principal_access_boundary_policy_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{organization}}/{{location}}/{{principal_access_boundary_policy_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, PrincipalAccessBoundaryPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iam/principalAccessBoundaryPolicy:PrincipalAccessBoundaryPolicy default organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/{{principal_access_boundary_policy_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iam/principalAccessBoundaryPolicy:PrincipalAccessBoundaryPolicy default {{organization}}/{{location}}/{{principal_access_boundary_policy_id}}
 * ```
