 * ## Import
 *
 * WorkloadIdentityPool can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{{workload_identity_pool_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{workload_identity_pool_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{workload_identity_pool_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, WorkloadIdentityPool can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iam/workloadIdentityPool:WorkloadIdentityPool default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{{workload_identity_pool_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iam/workloadIdentityPool:WorkloadIdentityPool default {{project}}/{{workload_identity_pool_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:iam/workloadIdentityPool:WorkloadIdentityPool default {{workload_identity_pool_id}}
 * ```
