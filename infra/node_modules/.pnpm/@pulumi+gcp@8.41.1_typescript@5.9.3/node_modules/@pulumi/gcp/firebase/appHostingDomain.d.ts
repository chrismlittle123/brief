/**
 * A domain name that is associated with a backend.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Firebase App Hosting Domain Minimal
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const serviceAccount = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("service_account", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     accountId: "sa-id",
 *     displayName: "Firebase App Hosting compute service account",
 *     createIgnoreAlreadyExists: true,
 * });
 * const exampleAppHostingBackend = new gcp.firebase.AppHostingBackend("example", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backendId: "domain-mini",
 *     appId: "1:0000000000:web:674cde32020e16fbce9dbd",
 *     servingLocality: "GLOBAL_ACCESS",
 *     serviceAccount: serviceAccount.email,
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.firebase.AppHostingDomain("example", {
 *     project: exampleAppHostingBackend.project,
 *     location: exampleAppHostingBackend.location,
 *     backend: exampleAppHostingBackend.backendId,
 *     domainId: "example.com",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Firebase App Hosting Domain Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const serviceAccount = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("service_account", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     accountId: "sa-id",
 *     displayName: "Firebase App Hosting compute service account",
 *     createIgnoreAlreadyExists: true,
 * });
 * const exampleAppHostingBackend = new gcp.firebase.AppHostingBackend("example", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backendId: "domain-full",
 *     appId: "1:0000000000:web:674cde32020e16fbce9dbd",
 *     servingLocality: "GLOBAL_ACCESS",
 *     serviceAccount: serviceAccount.email,
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.firebase.AppHostingDomain("example", {
 *     project: exampleAppHostingBackend.project,
 *     location: exampleAppHostingBackend.location,
 *     backend: exampleAppHostingBackend.backendId,
 *     domainId: "example.com",
 *     serve: {
 *         redirect: {
 *             uri: "google.com",
 *             status: "302",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Domain can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/domains/{{domain_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{domain_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{domain_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Domain can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appHostingDomain:AppHostingDomain default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/domains/{{domain_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appHostingDomain:AppHostingDomain default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{domain_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appHostingDomain:AppHostingDomain default {{location}}/{{backend}}/{{domain_id}}
 * ```
