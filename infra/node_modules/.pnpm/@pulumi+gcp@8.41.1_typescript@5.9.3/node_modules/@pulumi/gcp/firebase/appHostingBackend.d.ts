 * A Backend is the primary resource of App Hosting.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Firebase App Hosting Backend Minimal
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * //## Include these blocks only once per project if you are starting from scratch ###
 * const serviceAccount = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("service_account", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     accountId: "firebase-app-hosting-compute",
 *     displayName: "Firebase App Hosting compute service account",
 *     createIgnoreAlreadyExists: true,
 * });
 * const fah = new gcp.projects.Service("fah", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     service: "firebaseapphosting.googleapis.com",
 *     disableOnDestroy: false,

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Backend can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{backend_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Backend can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appHostingBackend:AppHostingBackend default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appHostingBackend:AppHostingBackend default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appHostingBackend:AppHostingBackend default {{location}}/{{backend_id}}
 * ```
