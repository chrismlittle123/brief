/**
 * A single build for a backend, at a specific point codebase reference tag
 * and point in time. Encapsulates several resources, including an Artifact Registry
 * container image, a Cloud Build invocation that built the image, and the
 * Cloud Run revision that uses that image.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Firebase App Hosting Build Minimal
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * //## Include these blocks only once per project if you are starting from scratch ###
 * const serviceAccount = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("service_account", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     accountId: "firebase-app-hosting-compute",
 *     displayName: "Firebase App Hosting compute service account",
 *     createIgnoreAlreadyExists: true,
 * });
 * const fah = new gcp.projects.Service("fah", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     service: "firebaseapphosting.googleapis.com",
 *     disableOnDestroy: false,
 * });
 * const exampleAppHostingBackend = new gcp.firebase.AppHostingBackend("example", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backendId: "mini",
 *     appId: "1:0000000000:web:674cde32020e16fbce9dbd",
 *     servingLocality: "GLOBAL_ACCESS",
 *     serviceAccount: serviceAccount.email,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [fah],
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.firebase.AppHostingBuild("example", {
 *     project: exampleAppHostingBackend.project,
 *     location: exampleAppHostingBackend.location,
 *     backend: exampleAppHostingBackend.backendId,
 *     buildId: "mini-build",
 *     source: {
 *         container: {
 *             image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * const appHostingSaRunner = new gcp.projects.IAMMember("app_hosting_sa_runner", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     role: "roles/firebaseapphosting.computeRunner",
 *     member: serviceAccount.member,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Firebase App Hosting Build Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * //## Include these blocks only once per project if you are starting from scratch ###
 * const serviceAccount = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("service_account", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     accountId: "firebase-app-hosting-compute",
 *     displayName: "Firebase App Hosting compute service account",
 *     createIgnoreAlreadyExists: true,
 * });
 * const fah = new gcp.projects.Service("fah", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     service: "firebaseapphosting.googleapis.com",
 *     disableOnDestroy: false,
 * });
 * const exampleAppHostingBackend = new gcp.firebase.AppHostingBackend("example", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backendId: "full",
 *     appId: "1:0000000000:web:674cde32020e16fbce9dbd",
 *     servingLocality: "GLOBAL_ACCESS",
 *     serviceAccount: serviceAccount.email,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [fah],
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.firebase.AppHostingBuild("example", {
 *     project: exampleAppHostingBackend.project,
 *     location: exampleAppHostingBackend.location,
 *     backend: exampleAppHostingBackend.backendId,
 *     buildId: "full-build",
 *     displayName: "My Build",
 *     annotations: {
 *         key: "value",
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         key: "value",
 *     },
 *     source: {
 *         container: {
 *             image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * const appHostingSaRunner = new gcp.projects.IAMMember("app_hosting_sa_runner", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     role: "roles/firebaseapphosting.computeRunner",
 *     member: serviceAccount.member,
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Import
 *
 * Build can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/builds/{{build_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{build_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{build_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Build can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appHostingBuild:AppHostingBuild default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/builds/{{build_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appHostingBuild:AppHostingBuild default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{build_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/appHostingBuild:AppHostingBuild default {{location}}/{{backend}}/{{build_id}}
 * ```
