import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * A Firebase Data Connect service.
 *
 * To get more information about Service, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/data-connect/rest)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Firebasedataconnect Service Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * // Enable Firebase Data Connect API
 * const fdc = new gcp.projects.Service("fdc", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     service: "firebasedataconnect.googleapis.com",
 *     disableOnDestroy: false,
 * });
 * // Create a Firebase Data Connect service
 * const _default = new gcp.firebase.DataConnectService("default", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     serviceId: "example-service",
 *     deletionPolicy: "DEFAULT",
 *     labels: {
 *         label: "my-label",
 *     },
 *     annotations: {
 *         key1: "value1",
 *         key2: "value2",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [fdc],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Firebasedataconnect Service With Force Deletion
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * // Enable Firebase Data Connect API
 * const fdc = new gcp.projects.Service("fdc", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     service: "firebasedataconnect.googleapis.com",
 *     disableOnDestroy: false,
 * });
 * // Create a Firebase Data Connect service
 * const _default = new gcp.firebase.DataConnectService("default", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     serviceId: "example-service",
 *     deletionPolicy: "FORCE",
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [fdc],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Service can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/services/{{service_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{service_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{service_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Service can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/dataConnectService:DataConnectService default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/services/{{service_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/dataConnectService:DataConnectService default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{service_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:firebase/dataConnectService:DataConnectService default {{location}}/{{service_id}}
 * ```
