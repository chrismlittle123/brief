 * The Eventarc Pipeline resource
 *
 * To get more information about Pipeline, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.pipelines)
 * * How-to Guides

 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const topic = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("topic", {name: "some-topic"});
 * const primary = new gcp.eventarc.Pipeline("primary", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     pipelineId: "some-pipeline",
 *     destinations: [{
 *         topic: topic.id,
 *     }],
 *     labels: {
 *         test_label: "test-eventarc-label",
 *     },
 *     annotations: {
 *         test_annotation: "test-eventarc-annotation",
 *     },
 *     displayName: "Testing Pipeline",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Eventarc Pipeline With Http Destination
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";

 * ```
 * ### Eventarc Pipeline With Workflow Destination
 *
 * ```typescript

 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const workflow = new gcp.workflows.Workflow("workflow", {
 *     name: "some-workflow",

 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     sourceContents: `# This is a sample workflow, feel free to replace it with your source code
 * #
 * # This workflow does the following:
 * # - reads current time and date information from an external API and stores
 * #   the response in CurrentDateTime variable
 * # - retrieves a list of Wikipedia articles related to the day of the week
 * #   from CurrentDateTime
 * # - returns the list of articles as an output of the workflow
 * # FYI, In terraform you need to escape the  or it will cause errors.
 *
 * - getCurrentTime:

 *             action: opensearch
 *             search: \${CurrentDateTime.body.dayOfTheWeek}
 *     result: WikiResult
 * - returnOutput:

 * `,

 * ## Import
 *
 * Pipeline can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/pipelines/{{pipeline_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{pipeline_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{pipeline_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Pipeline can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:eventarc/pipeline:Pipeline default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/pipelines/{{pipeline_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:eventarc/pipeline:Pipeline default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{pipeline_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:eventarc/pipeline:Pipeline default {{location}}/{{pipeline_id}}
 * ```
