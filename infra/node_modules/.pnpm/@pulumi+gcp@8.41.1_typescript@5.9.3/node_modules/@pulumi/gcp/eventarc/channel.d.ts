 * To get more information about Channel, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.channels)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/standard/docs/third-parties/create-channels)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Eventarc Channel With Cmek
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const primary = new gcp.eventarc.Channel("primary", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     name: "some-channel",
 *     cryptoKeyName: "some-key",
 *     thirdPartyProvider: "projects/my-project-name/locations/us-central1/providers/datadog",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Channel can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/channels/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Channel can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:eventarc/channel:Channel default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/channels/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:eventarc/channel:Channel default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:eventarc/channel:Channel default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
