 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Backup Dr Backup Vault Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const backup_vault_test = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupVault("backup-vault-test", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backupVaultId: "backup-vault-test",
 *     description: "This is a second backup vault built by Terraform.",
 *     backupMinimumEnforcedRetentionDuration: "100000s",
 *     annotations: {
 *         annotations1: "bar1",
 *         annotations2: "baz1",
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar1",
 *         bar: "baz1",
 *     },
 *     forceUpdate: true,
 *     accessRestriction: "WITHIN_ORGANIZATION",
 *     backupRetentionInheritance: "INHERIT_VAULT_RETENTION",
 *     ignoreInactiveDatasources: true,
 *     ignoreBackupPlanReferences: true,

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * BackupVault can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupVaults/{{backup_vault_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_vault_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{backup_vault_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, BackupVault can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:backupdisasterrecovery/backupVault:BackupVault default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupVaults/{{backup_vault_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:backupdisasterrecovery/backupVault:BackupVault default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_vault_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:backupdisasterrecovery/backupVault:BackupVault default {{location}}/{{backup_vault_id}}
 * ```
