 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Backup Dr Bpa
 *
 * ```typescript

 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const mySA = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("mySA", {
 *     accountId: "my-custom",
 *     displayName: "Custom SA for VM Instance",
 * });
 * const myinstance = new gcp.compute.Instance("myinstance", {
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         accessConfigs: [{}],
 *         network: "default",
 *     }],
 *     name: "test-instance",
 *     machineType: "n2-standard-2",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",

 *         email: mySA.email,
 *         scopes: ["cloud-platform"],
 *     },
 * });
 * const bv1 = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupVault("bv1", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backupVaultId: "bv-bpa",
 *     backupMinimumEnforcedRetentionDuration: "100000s",
 *     forceDelete: true,
 * });
 * const bp1 = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupPlan("bp1", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backupPlanId: "bp-bpa-test",
 *     resourceType: "compute.googleapis.com/Instance",
 *     backupVault: bv1.id,
 *     backupRules: [{
 *         ruleId: "rule-1",
 *         backupRetentionDays: 2,
 *         standardSchedule: {
 *             recurrenceType: "HOURLY",
 *             hourlyFrequency: 6,
 *             timeZone: "UTC",
 *             backupWindow: {
 *                 startHourOfDay: 12,
 *                 endHourOfDay: 18,
 *             },
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * const my_backup_plan_association = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupPlanAssociation("my-backup-plan-association", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     resourceType: "compute.googleapis.com/Instance",
 *     backupPlanAssociationId: "my-bpa",
 *     resource: myinstance.id,
 *     backupPlan: bp1.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * BackupPlanAssociation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlanAssociations/{{backup_plan_association_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_association_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{backup_plan_association_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, BackupPlanAssociation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:backupdisasterrecovery/backupPlanAssociation:BackupPlanAssociation default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlanAssociations/{{backup_plan_association_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:backupdisasterrecovery/backupPlanAssociation:BackupPlanAssociation default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_association_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:backupdisasterrecovery/backupPlanAssociation:BackupPlanAssociation default {{location}}/{{backup_plan_association_id}}
 * ```
