/**
 * A backup plan defines when and how to back up a resource, including the backup's schedule, retention, and location.
 *
 * To get more information about BackupPlan, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs/reference/rest)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Backup Dr Backup Plan Simple
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myBackupVault = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupVault("my_backup_vault", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backupVaultId: "backup-vault-simple-test",
 *     backupMinimumEnforcedRetentionDuration: "100000s",
 * });
 * const my_backup_plan_1 = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupPlan("my-backup-plan-1", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backupPlanId: "backup-plan-simple-test",
 *     resourceType: "compute.googleapis.com/Instance",
 *     backupVault: myBackupVault.id,
 *     backupRules: [{
 *         ruleId: "rule-1",
 *         backupRetentionDays: 5,
 *         standardSchedule: {
 *             recurrenceType: "HOURLY",
 *             hourlyFrequency: 6,
 *             timeZone: "UTC",
 *             backupWindow: {
 *                 startHourOfDay: 0,
 *                 endHourOfDay: 24,
 *             },
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Backup Dr Backup Plan For Disk Resource
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myBackupVault = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupVault("my_backup_vault", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backupVaultId: "backup-vault-disk-test",
 *     backupMinimumEnforcedRetentionDuration: "100000s",
 * });
 * const my_disk_backup_plan_1 = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupPlan("my-disk-backup-plan-1", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backupPlanId: "backup-plan-disk-test",
 *     resourceType: "compute.googleapis.com/Disk",
 *     backupVault: myBackupVault.id,
 *     backupRules: [{
 *         ruleId: "rule-1",
 *         backupRetentionDays: 5,
 *         standardSchedule: {
 *             recurrenceType: "HOURLY",
 *             hourlyFrequency: 1,
 *             timeZone: "UTC",
 *             backupWindow: {
 *                 startHourOfDay: 0,
 *                 endHourOfDay: 6,
 *             },
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Backup Dr Backup Plan For Csql Resource
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myBackupVault = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupVault("my_backup_vault", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backupVaultId: "backup-vault-csql-test",
 *     backupMinimumEnforcedRetentionDuration: "100000s",
 * });
 * const my_csql_backup_plan_1 = new gcp.backupdisasterrecovery.BackupPlan("my-csql-backup-plan-1", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     backupPlanId: "backup-plan-csql-test",
 *     resourceType: "sqladmin.googleapis.com/Instance",
 *     backupVault: myBackupVault.id,
 *     backupRules: [{
 *         ruleId: "rule-1",
 *         backupRetentionDays: 5,
 *         standardSchedule: {
 *             recurrenceType: "HOURLY",
 *             hourlyFrequency: 6,
 *             timeZone: "UTC",
 *             backupWindow: {
 *                 startHourOfDay: 0,
 *                 endHourOfDay: 6,
 *             },
 *         },
 *     }],
 *     logRetentionDays: 4,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * BackupPlan can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, BackupPlan can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:backupdisasterrecovery/backupPlan:BackupPlan default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:backupdisasterrecovery/backupPlan:BackupPlan default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:backupdisasterrecovery/backupPlan:BackupPlan default {{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}
 * ```
