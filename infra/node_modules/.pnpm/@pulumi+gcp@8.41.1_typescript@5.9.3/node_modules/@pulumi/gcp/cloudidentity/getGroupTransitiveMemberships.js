/**
 * Use this data source to get list of the Cloud Identity Group Memberships within a given Group. Whereas `gcp.cloudidentity.getGroupMemberships` returns details of only direct members of the group, `gcp.cloudidentity.getGroupTransitiveMemberships` will return details about both direct and indirect members. For example, a user is an indirect member of Group A if the user is a direct member of Group B and Group B is a direct member of Group A.
