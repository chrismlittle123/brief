/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Compute Cross Site Network Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * const example_cross_site_network = new gcp.compute.CrossSiteNetwork("example-cross-site-network", {
 *     name: "test-cross-site-network",
 *     description: "Example cross site network",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * CrossSiteNetwork can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/crossSiteNetworks/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, CrossSiteNetwork can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/crossSiteNetwork:CrossSiteNetwork default projects/{{project}}/global/crossSiteNetworks/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/crossSiteNetwork:CrossSiteNetwork default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/crossSiteNetwork:CrossSiteNetwork default {{name}}
 * ```
