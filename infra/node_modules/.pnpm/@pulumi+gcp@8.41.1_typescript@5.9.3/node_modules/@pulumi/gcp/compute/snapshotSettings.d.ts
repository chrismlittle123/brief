/**
 * Updates your project's snapshot settings and sets a new default storage location for snapshots.
 *
 * To get more information about SnapshotSettings, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/snapshotSettings)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/snapshot-settings#snapshot_settings_how_to_update)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Snapshot Settings Specific Locations
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const tf_test_snapshot_settings = new gcp.compute.SnapshotSettings("tf-test-snapshot-settings", {storageLocation: {
 *     policy: "SPECIFIC_LOCATIONS",
 *     locations: [{
 *         name: "us-central1",
 *         location: "us-central1",
 *     }],
 * }});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * SnapshotSettings can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/global/snapshotSettings/`
 *
 * * `{{project}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, SnapshotSettings can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/snapshotSettings:SnapshotSettings default projects/{{project}}/global/snapshotSettings/
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/snapshotSettings:SnapshotSettings default {{project}}
 * ```
