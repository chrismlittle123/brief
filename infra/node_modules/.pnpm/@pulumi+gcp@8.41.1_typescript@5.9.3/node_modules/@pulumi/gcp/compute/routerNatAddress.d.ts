/**
 * A resource used to set the list of IP addresses to be used in a NAT service and manage the draining of destroyed IPs.
 *
 * > **Note:** This resource is to be used alongside a `gcp.compute.RouterNat` resource,
 * the router nat resource must have no defined `natIps` or `drainNatIps` parameters,
 * instead using the `initialNatIps` parameter to set at least one IP for the creation of the resource.
 *
 * To get more information about RouterNatAddress, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/routers)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Google Cloud Router](https://cloud.google.com/router/docs/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * RouterNatAddress can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/routers/{{router}}/{{router_nat}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{router}}/{{router_nat}}`
 *
 * * `{{region}}/{{router}}/{{router_nat}}`
 *
 * * `{{router}}/{{router_nat}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, RouterNatAddress can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/routerNatAddress:RouterNatAddress default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/routers/{{router}}/{{router_nat}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/routerNatAddress:RouterNatAddress default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{router}}/{{router_nat}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/routerNatAddress:RouterNatAddress default {{region}}/{{router}}/{{router_nat}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:compute/routerNatAddress:RouterNatAddress default {{router}}/{{router_nat}}
 * ```
