import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Allows management of a Google Cloud Platform folder. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders)
 * and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v2/folders).
 *
 * A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Cloud Platform resources. Folders allows you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies.
 *
 * Folders created live inside an Organization. See the [Organization documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/quickstarts) for more details.
 *
 * The service account used to run the provider when creating a `gcp.organizations.Folder`
 * resource must have `roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator`. See the
 * [Access Control for Folders Using IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-folders)
 * doc for more information.
 *
 * > It may take a while for the attached tag bindings to be deleted after the folder is scheduled to be deleted.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Folders can be imported using the folder's id, e.g.
 *
 * * `folders/{{folder_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{folder_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Folders can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/folder:Folder default {{folder_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/folder:Folder default folders/{{folder_id}}
 * ```
