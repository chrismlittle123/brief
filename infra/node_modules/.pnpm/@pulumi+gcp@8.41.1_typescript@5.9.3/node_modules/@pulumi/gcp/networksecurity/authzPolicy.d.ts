/**
 * AuthzPolicy is a resource that allows to forward traffic to a callout backend designed to scan the traffic for security purposes.
 *
 * To get more information about AuthzPolicy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/reference/network-security/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.authzPolicies)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * AuthzPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/authzPolicies/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, AuthzPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/authzPolicy:AuthzPolicy default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/authzPolicies/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/authzPolicy:AuthzPolicy default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/authzPolicy:AuthzPolicy default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/authzPolicy:AuthzPolicy default {{name}}
 * ```
