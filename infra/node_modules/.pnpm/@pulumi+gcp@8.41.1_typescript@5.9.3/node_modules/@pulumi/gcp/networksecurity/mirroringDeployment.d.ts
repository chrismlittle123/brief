/**
 * A deployment represents a zonal mirroring backend ready to accept
 * GENEVE-encapsulated replica traffic, e.g. a zonal instance group fronted by
 * an internal passthrough load balancer. Deployments are always part of a
 * global deployment group which represents a global mirroring service.
 *
 * To get more information about MirroringDeployment, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.mirroringDeployments)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Mirroring deployment overview](https://cloud.google.com/network-security-integration/docs/out-of-band/deployments-overview)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Network Security Mirroring Deployment Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network = new gcp.compute.Network("network", {
 *     name: "example-network",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * });
 * const subnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("subnetwork", {
 *     name: "example-subnet",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.1.0.0/16",
 *     network: network.name,
 * });
 * const healthCheck = new gcp.compute.RegionHealthCheck("health_check", {
 *     name: "example-hc",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     httpHealthCheck: {
 *         port: 80,
 *     },
 * });
 * const backendService = new gcp.compute.RegionBackendService("backend_service", {
 *     name: "example-bs",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     healthChecks: healthCheck.id,
 *     protocol: "UDP",
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "INTERNAL",
 * });
 * const forwardingRule = new gcp.compute.ForwardingRule("forwarding_rule", {
 *     name: "example-fwr",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: network.name,
 *     subnetwork: subnetwork.name,
 *     backendService: backendService.id,
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "INTERNAL",
 *     ports: ["6081"],
 *     ipProtocol: "UDP",
 *     isMirroringCollector: true,
 * });
 * const deploymentGroup = new gcp.networksecurity.MirroringDeploymentGroup("deployment_group", {
 *     mirroringDeploymentGroupId: "example-dg",
 *     location: "global",
 *     network: network.id,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.networksecurity.MirroringDeployment("default", {
 *     mirroringDeploymentId: "example-deployment",
 *     location: "us-central1-a",
 *     forwardingRule: forwardingRule.id,
 *     mirroringDeploymentGroup: deploymentGroup.id,
 *     description: "some description",
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * MirroringDeployment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringDeployments/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, MirroringDeployment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/mirroringDeployment:MirroringDeployment default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringDeployments/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/mirroringDeployment:MirroringDeployment default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:networksecurity/mirroringDeployment:MirroringDeployment default {{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}
 * ```
