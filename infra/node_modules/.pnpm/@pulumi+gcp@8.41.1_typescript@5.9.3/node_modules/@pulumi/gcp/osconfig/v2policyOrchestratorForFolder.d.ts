/**
 * PolicyOrchestrator helps managing project+zone level policy resources (e.g.
 * OS Policy Assignments), by providing tools to create, update and delete them
 * across projects and locations, at scale.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Osconfigv2 Policy Orchestrator For Folder Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * import * as time from "@pulumiverse/time";
 *
 * const myFolder = new gcp.organizations.Folder("my_folder", {

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * PolicyOrchestratorForFolder can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `folders/{{folder_id}}/locations/global/policyOrchestrators/{{policy_orchestrator_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{folder_id}}/{{policy_orchestrator_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, PolicyOrchestratorForFolder can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/v2PolicyOrchestratorForFolder:V2PolicyOrchestratorForFolder default folders/{{folder_id}}/locations/global/policyOrchestrators/{{policy_orchestrator_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/v2PolicyOrchestratorForFolder:V2PolicyOrchestratorForFolder default {{folder_id}}/{{policy_orchestrator_id}}
 * ```
