/**
 * PolicyOrchestrator helps managing project+zone level policy resources (e.g.
 * OS Policy Assignments), by providing tools to create, update and delete them
 * across projects and locations, at scale.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Osconfigv2 Policy Orchestrator Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const policyOrchestrator = new gcp.osconfig.V2PolicyOrchestrator("policy_orchestrator", {
 *     policyOrchestratorId: "po",
 *     state: "ACTIVE",
 *     action: "UPSERT",
 *     orchestratedResource: {
 *         id: "test-orchestrated-resource",
 *         osPolicyAssignmentV1Payload: {
 *             osPolicies: [{
 *                 id: "test-os-policy",
 *                 mode: "VALIDATION",
 *                 resourceGroups: [{
 *                     resources: [{
 *                         id: "resource-tf",
 *                         file: {
 *                             content: "file-content-tf",
 *                             path: "file-path-tf-1",
 *                             state: "PRESENT",
 *                         },
 *                     }],
 *                 }],
 *             }],
 *             instanceFilter: {
 *                 inventories: [{
 *                     osShortName: "windows-10",
 *                 }],
 *             },
 *             rollout: {
 *                 disruptionBudget: {
 *                     percent: 100,
 *                 },
 *                 minWaitDuration: "60s",
 *             },
 *         },
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         state: "active",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * PolicyOrchestrator can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/policyOrchestrators/{{policy_orchestrator_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{policy_orchestrator_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{policy_orchestrator_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, PolicyOrchestrator can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/v2PolicyOrchestrator:V2PolicyOrchestrator default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/policyOrchestrators/{{policy_orchestrator_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/v2PolicyOrchestrator:V2PolicyOrchestrator default {{project}}/{{policy_orchestrator_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/v2PolicyOrchestrator:V2PolicyOrchestrator default {{policy_orchestrator_id}}
 * ```
