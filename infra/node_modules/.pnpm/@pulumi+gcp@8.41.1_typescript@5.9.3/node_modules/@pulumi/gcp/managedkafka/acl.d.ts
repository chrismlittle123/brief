/**
 * A Managed Service for Apache Kafka ACL. Apache Kafka is a trademark owned by the Apache Software Foundation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Managedkafka Acl Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * const cluster = new gcp.managedkafka.Cluster("cluster", {
 *     clusterId: "my-cluster",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     capacityConfig: {
 *         vcpuCount: "3",
 *         memoryBytes: "3221225472",
 *     },
 *     gcpConfig: {
 *         accessConfig: {
 *             networkConfigs: [{
 *                 subnet: project.then(project => `projects/${project.number}/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/default`),
 *             }],
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.managedkafka.Acl("example", {
 *     aclId: "topic/mytopic",
 *     cluster: cluster.clusterId,
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     aclEntries: [
 *         {
 *             principal: "User:admin@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
 *             permissionType: "ALLOW",
 *             operation: "ALL",
 *             host: "*",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             principal: "User:producer-client@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
 *             permissionType: "ALLOW",
 *             operation: "WRITE",
 *             host: "*",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Acl can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/clusters/{{cluster}}/acls/{{acl_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Acl can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:managedkafka/acl:Acl default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/clusters/{{cluster}}/acls/{{acl_id}}
 * ```
