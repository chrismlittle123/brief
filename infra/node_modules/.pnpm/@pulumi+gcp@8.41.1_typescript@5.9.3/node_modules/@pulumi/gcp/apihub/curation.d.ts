 * Description

 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Apihub Curation Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const apihubCurationBasic = new gcp.apihub.Curation("apihub_curation_basic", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     curationId: "test",
 *     project: "apihub-terraform",
 *     displayName: "Test Curation",
 *     description: "This is a sample curation resource managed by Terraform.",
 *     endpoint: {
 *         applicationIntegrationEndpointDetails: {
 *             triggerId: "api_trigger/curation_API_1",
 *             uri: "https://integrations.googleapis.com/v1/projects/1082615593856/locations/us-central1/integrations/curation:execute",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Curation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/curations/{{curation_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{curation_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{curation_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Curation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:apihub/curation:Curation default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/curations/{{curation_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:apihub/curation:Curation default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{curation_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:apihub/curation:Curation default {{location}}/{{curation_id}}
 * ```
