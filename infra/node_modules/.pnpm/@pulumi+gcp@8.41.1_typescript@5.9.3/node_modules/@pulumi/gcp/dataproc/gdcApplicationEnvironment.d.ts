/**
 * An ApplicationEnvironment contains shared configuration that may be referenced by multiple SparkApplications.
 *
 * To get more information about ApplicationEnvironment, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-gdc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.applicationEnvironments)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Dataproc Intro](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Dataprocgdc Applicationenvironment Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const application_environment = new gcp.dataproc.GdcApplicationEnvironment("application-environment", {
 *     applicationEnvironmentId: "dp-tf-e2e-application-environment-basic",
 *     serviceinstance: "do-not-delete-dataproc-gdc-instance",
 *     project: "my-project",
 *     location: "us-west2",
 *     namespace: "default",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Dataprocgdc Applicationenvironment
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const application_environment = new gcp.dataproc.GdcApplicationEnvironment("application-environment", {
 *     applicationEnvironmentId: "dp-tf-e2e-application-environment",
 *     serviceinstance: "do-not-delete-dataproc-gdc-instance",
 *     project: "my-project",
 *     location: "us-west2",
 *     namespace: "default",
 *     displayName: "An application environment",
 *     labels: {
 *         "test-label": "label-value",
 *     },
 *     annotations: {
 *         an_annotation: "annotation_value",
 *     },
 *     sparkApplicationEnvironmentConfig: {
 *         defaultProperties: {
 *             "spark.executor.memory": "4g",
 *         },
 *         defaultVersion: "1.2",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ApplicationEnvironment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/serviceInstances/{{serviceinstance}}/applicationEnvironments/{{application_environment_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{serviceinstance}}/{{application_environment_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{serviceinstance}}/{{application_environment_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, ApplicationEnvironment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:dataproc/gdcApplicationEnvironment:GdcApplicationEnvironment default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/serviceInstances/{{serviceinstance}}/applicationEnvironments/{{application_environment_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:dataproc/gdcApplicationEnvironment:GdcApplicationEnvironment default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{serviceinstance}}/{{application_environment_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:dataproc/gdcApplicationEnvironment:GdcApplicationEnvironment default {{location}}/{{serviceinstance}}/{{application_environment_id}}
 * ```
