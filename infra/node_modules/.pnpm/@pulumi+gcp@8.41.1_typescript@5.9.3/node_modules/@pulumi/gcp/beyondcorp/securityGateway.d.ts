/**
 * Deployment of Security Gateway.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Beyondcorp Security Gateway Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.beyondcorp.SecurityGateway("example", {
 *     securityGatewayId: "default",
 *     displayName: "My Security Gateway resource",
 *     hubs: [{
 *         region: "us-central1",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * SecurityGateway can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/securityGateways/{{security_gateway_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{security_gateway_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{security_gateway_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, SecurityGateway can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:beyondcorp/securityGateway:SecurityGateway default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/securityGateways/{{security_gateway_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:beyondcorp/securityGateway:SecurityGateway default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{security_gateway_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:beyondcorp/securityGateway:SecurityGateway default {{location}}/{{security_gateway_id}}
 * ```
