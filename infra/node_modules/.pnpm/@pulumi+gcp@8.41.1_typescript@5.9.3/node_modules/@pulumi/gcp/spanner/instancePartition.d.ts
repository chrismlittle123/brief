/**
 * A Cloud Spanner instance partition is a unit of Cloud Spanner database capacity
 * that can be used to partition data and processing capacity within an instance.
 *
 * To get more information about InstancePartition, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.instances.instancePartitions)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/geo-partitioning)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Spanner Instance Partition Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const main = new gcp.spanner.Instance("main", {
 *     name: "test-instance",
 *     config: "nam6",
 *     displayName: "main-instance",
 *     numNodes: 1,
 *     edition: "ENTERPRISE_PLUS",
 * });
 * const partition = new gcp.spanner.InstancePartition("partition", {
 *     name: "test-partition",
 *     instance: main.name,
 *     config: "nam8",
 *     displayName: "test-spanner-partition",
 *     nodeCount: 1,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * InstancePartition can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/instances/{{instance}}/instancePartitions/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{instance}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * * `{{instance}}/{{name}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, InstancePartition can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/instancePartition:InstancePartition default projects/{{project}}/instances/{{instance}}/instancePartitions/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/instancePartition:InstancePartition default {{project}}/{{instance}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/instancePartition:InstancePartition default {{instance}}/{{name}}
 * ```
