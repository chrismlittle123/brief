import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Represents a collection of categories and terms defined by the user. Glossary is a top level resource and is the GCP parent resource of all the categories and terms within it.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Dataplex Glossary Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const glossaryTestId = new gcp.dataplex.Glossary("glossary_test_id", {
 *     glossaryId: "glossary-basic",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Dataplex Glossary Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const glossaryTestIdFull = new gcp.dataplex.Glossary("glossary_test_id_full", {
 *     glossaryId: "glossary-full",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     labels: {
 *         tag: "test-tf",
 *     },
 *     displayName: "terraform glossary",
 *     description: "glossary created by Terraform",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Glossary can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/glossaries/{{glossary_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{glossary_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{glossary_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Glossary can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:dataplex/glossary:Glossary default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/glossaries/{{glossary_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:dataplex/glossary:Glossary default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{glossary_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:dataplex/glossary:Glossary default {{location}}/{{glossary_id}}
 * ```
