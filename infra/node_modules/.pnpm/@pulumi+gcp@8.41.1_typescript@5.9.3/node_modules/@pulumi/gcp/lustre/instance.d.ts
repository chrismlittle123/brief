import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * A Managed Lustre instance
 *
 * To get more information about Instance, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.instances)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/create-instance)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Lustre Instance Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * // This example assumes this network already exists.
 * // The API creates a tenant network per network authorized for a
 * // Lustre instance and that network is not deleted when the user-created
 * // network (authorized_network) is deleted, so this prevents issues
 * // with tenant network quota.
 * // If this network hasn't been created and you are using this example in your
 * // config, add an additional network resource or change
 * // this from "data"to "resource"
 * const lustre_network = gcp.compute.getNetwork({
 *     name: "my-network",
 * });
 * const instance = new gcp.lustre.Instance("instance", {
 *     instanceId: "my-instance",
 *     location: "us-central1-a",
 *     description: "test lustre instance",
 *     filesystem: "testfs",
 *     capacityGib: "18000",
 *     network: lustre_network.then(lustre_network => lustre_network.id),
 *     perUnitStorageThroughput: "1000",
 *     labels: {
 *         test: "value",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Instance can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, Instance can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:lustre/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:lustre/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:lustre/instance:Instance default {{location}}/{{instance_id}}
 * ```
