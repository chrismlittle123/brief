/**
 * A Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) Big Query Export Config.
 * It represents exporting Security Command Center data, including assets, findings, and security marks
 * using gcloud scc bqexports
 * > **Note:** In order to use Cloud SCC resources, your organization must be enrolled
 * in [SCC Standard/Premium](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/quickstart-security-command-center).
 * Without doing so, you may run into errors during resource creation.
 *
 * To get more information about FolderSccBigQueryExport, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/v2/folders.locations.bigQueryExports)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-analyze-findings-in-big-query)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Scc V2 Folder Big Query Export Config Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const folder = new gcp.organizations.Folder("folder", {
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     displayName: "folder-name",
 *     deletionProtection: false,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("default", {
 *     datasetId: "my_dataset_id",
 *     friendlyName: "test",
 *     description: "This is a test description",
 *     location: "US",
 *     defaultTableExpirationMs: 3600000,
 *     defaultPartitionExpirationMs: null,
 *     labels: {
 *         env: "default",
 *     },
 * });
 * const customBigQueryExportConfig = new gcp.securitycenter.V2FolderSccBigQueryExport("custom_big_query_export_config", {
 *     bigQueryExportId: "my-export",
 *     folder: folder.folderId,
 *     dataset: _default.id,
 *     location: "global",
 *     description: "Cloud Security Command Center Findings Big Query Export Config",
 *     filter: "state=\"ACTIVE\" AND NOT mute=\"MUTED\"",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * FolderSccBigQueryExport can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `folders/{{folder}}/locations/{{location}}/bigQueryExports/{{big_query_export_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{folder}}/{{location}}/{{big_query_export_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, FolderSccBigQueryExport can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:securitycenter/v2FolderSccBigQueryExport:V2FolderSccBigQueryExport default folders/{{folder}}/locations/{{location}}/bigQueryExports/{{big_query_export_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:securitycenter/v2FolderSccBigQueryExport:V2FolderSccBigQueryExport default {{folder}}/{{location}}/{{big_query_export_id}}
 * ```
