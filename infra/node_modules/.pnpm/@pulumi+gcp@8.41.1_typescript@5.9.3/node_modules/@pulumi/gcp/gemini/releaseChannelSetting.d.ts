/**
 * The resource for managing ReleaseChannel settings for Admin Control.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Gemini Release Channel Setting Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.gemini.ReleaseChannelSetting("example", {
 *     releaseChannelSettingId: "ls1-tf",
 *     location: "global",
 *     labels: {
 *         my_key: "my_value",
 *     },
 *     releaseChannel: "EXPERIMENTAL",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ReleaseChannelSetting can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
 *
 * * `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/releaseChannelSettings/{{release_channel_setting_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{release_channel_setting_id}}`
 *
 * * `{{location}}/{{release_channel_setting_id}}`
 *
 * When using the `pulumi import` command, ReleaseChannelSetting can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:gemini/releaseChannelSetting:ReleaseChannelSetting default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/releaseChannelSettings/{{release_channel_setting_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:gemini/releaseChannelSetting:ReleaseChannelSetting default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{release_channel_setting_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import gcp:gemini/releaseChannelSetting:ReleaseChannelSetting default {{location}}/{{release_channel_setting_id}}
 * ```
